# TicTacToe-With-Java
This Java program is a Tic Tac Toe game built using JavaFX. It features a 3x3 grid where players alternate marking Xs and Os. The `TicTacToe` class sets up the game interface, handles player moves, and checks for a winner after each turn. It uses a 2D array to track moves and displays a winner alert through an `Alert` box when the game ends.
